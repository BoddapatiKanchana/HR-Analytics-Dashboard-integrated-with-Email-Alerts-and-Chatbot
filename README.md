# HR Analytics Dashboard Integrated with Email Alerts and Chatbot

##  Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Summer Internship at Innodatatics (USA)** during the MBA (Business Analytics) program at the **University of Hyderabad**.  

The objective of the project is to transform traditional HR reporting into an **interactive, intelligent, and decision-support system** by integrating:
- HR Analytics Dashboard
- Email Alert System
- NLP-based Chatbot

The solution enables HR managers to proactively monitor workforce metrics, identify retention risks, and interact with data using natural language queries.

## Project Objectives
- Visualize key HR metrics such as employee demographics, tenure, performance, salary, and retention risk
- Identify high attrition risk employees and departments
- Implement **manual email alerts** for controlled HR communication
- Display **real-time dashboard refresh and email status alerts**
- Enable **chatbot-based self-service analytics** for non-technical HR users
