# HR Analytics Dashboard Integrated with Email Alerts and Chatbot

##  Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Summer Internship at Innodatatics (USA)** during the MBA (Business Analytics) program at the **University of Hyderabad**.  

The objective of the project is to transform traditional HR reporting into an **interactive, intelligent, and decision-support system** by integrating:
- HR Analytics Dashboard
- Email Alert System

The solution enables HR managers to proactively monitor workforce metrics, identify retention risks, and interact with data using natural language queries.
